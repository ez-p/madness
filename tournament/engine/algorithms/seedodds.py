#
# Implement a matchup between two teams
# Different algorithms can be created as long as the class implementation:
# 1) Takes a tuple of Team objects and a madness variable in contructor
# 2) Implements a 'play' method that returns a tuple of (winner,loser) Team objects
#
# Notes:
#   This algorithm uses the difference between the seeds as the probability one team
#   will beat a different team.  For example, there is a small chance that a #1 seed
#   will loose to a #16 seed.  In this algorithm, the #16 is given a 1 in 15 chances.
#   A #3 seed vs a #6 seed will get a 1 in 4 chance since the calculation is:
#
#     Create a range of numbers between seeds: [3, 4, 5]
#     Randomly select a number between 3-6
#     The lesser team wins only when the random number is 6, which is the only number
#     that can be selected that is not in the list.
#
#     Another example #2 vs #8:
#        Range is [2,3,4,5,6,7]
#        Select a random number betwee 2-8
#        If random number is 8, then lesser team wins
#
#   The chance of winning is adjusted by:
#      madness: The level of madness introduced in the tournament
#        power: The power level of the team
#
#   Madness adjusts the lesser teams chance of winning up by decreasing the range of
#   of numbers in the range list, thus introducing some madness in the tournament.
#
#   By default madness is set to one, which represents the 'average' amount of madness.
#   Meaning for a large number of runs, the madness converages to the average.
#
#   Power adjusts a teams chance of winning by moving the opponents seed up.
#     Example #1 vs #2 (#1 has power of 1, as it a very dominant team)
#        Opponents seed is adjusted up by 1, so now it is essentially #1 vs #3.
#        Therefore, #1 seed has an even better chance of winning.
#        
#     Example #3 vs #8 (#8 has power of 1)
#        Opponents seed is adjusted up by 1, so now it is #4 vs #8
#        Therefore, #3's advantage has shrunk
